Technical Project Management Handbook (Structured for RAG)
===========================================================

This handbook provides a week-by-week guide for technical project leads managing student teams through a semester-long sprint-driven development project.

-------------------------------
SPRINT 0 (Jan 6 - Jan 13): Preparation
-------------------------------
- Create a full 12-week sprint outline
- Set up a single Google Sheet with:
    • 12-week Sprint Schedule
    • Task Backlog & Sprint Progress Board
- Backwards-plan from final deliverable, set conservative sprint goals
- Begin populating backlog (even with only 1-2 sprints' worth of tasks)
- Encourage teams to self-assign tasks into "In Progress" column
- Clarify with client:
    • Understand costs (e.g., LLM usage)
    • Gather needed materials early (e.g., datasets)
    • Agree on communication frequency
    • Ask about required tech stack

-------------------------------
SPRINT 1 (Jan 13 - Jan 27): Project Kickoff
-------------------------------
- Launch communication:
    • Group chat
    • Introductory meeting to align expectations
    • Encourage early sharing of blockers
    • Weekly hour commitment: 3–5 hrs/week
    • Set async stand-up schedule (1–2 updates/week)
- Promote ticket independence and collaboration
- Expect real progress during this sprint
- Complete Sprint Retro & Planning doc before next all-hands
    • Upload to team folder: “Sprint [#]: [TEAM NAME]”

-------------------------------
SPRINT 2 (Jan 27 - Feb 10): Building Momentum
-------------------------------
- Attend all-hands on Day 1: demo progress and show completed tickets
- Ensure team is working toward final deliverable
- Mid-sprint check-in (Day 8): claim tickets, escalate blockers early
- End-of-sprint team retro: complete and upload Sprint Retro & Planning doc
- Send client a progress update

-------------------------------
