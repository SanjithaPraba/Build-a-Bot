What is a Hackathon?
A hackathon is a 24-hour tech event for teams of students to learn new skills, build cool tech projects, and meet tons of other students and tech professionals. There will be food, awesome workshops, and super cool swag for all hackers!

How much will it cost?
There is absolutely no cost for attending our hackathon! We will provide all the resources for you to participate comfortably.

Do I need a team?
If you are planning to compete for a prize, you may be in a team of 1–4 people. If you don’t have one yet, no worries! We will have a team formation workshop before hacking begins.

Who can attend?
All current undergraduate, graduate, and high school students at least 18 years of age may attend HooHacks. No coding experience is necessary! Non-STEM majors, first-time hackers, and beginner coders are encouraged to join us!

What are the logistics?
HooHacks 2025 will be taking place at the University of Virginia. Information regarding schedule of events and more are coming soon!

HooHacks will also be offering travel reimbursement this year! More information on our travel reimbursement policies can be found here: [link]
